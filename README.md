Title: St. Mary's Heart Primary School Math Skills Assessment Program

Description:
A Python-based CLI , Math Skill Assessment program tailored for St. Mary's Heart Primary School students. The program is designed to evaluate both mental math and language-based math abilities.

Upon initiation, students are presented with mental math questions. Upon successfully answering over 4 questions correctly, they transition to language-based math questions. However, if they fail to achieve the required score, the program displays a message indicating test failure, along with a summary of the total score for the mental math section, including the number of correct and incorrect answers.

Once the student completes the language math test, the program outputs comprehensive results. It displays the student's name, age, total score for mental math, the count of correct and incorrect mental math answers, followed by the total score for the language math test, along with correct and incorrect language math scores.

This repository provides an interactive and educational tool to assess and enhance the math skills of St. Mary's Heart Primary School students, offering detailed insights into their mental and language-based mathematical capabilities.
